# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
> This project aims to analyze customer churn, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights to reduce churn rates. We explore customer demographics, payment methods, and contract types to uncover patterns associated with churn. We also predict which customers are most likely to leave, providing business recommendations based on the analysis.

## Overview
> Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time. The goal of this project is to:
Explore and understand factors influencing customer churn.
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Provide recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Telco Customer Churn. It includes information such as customer demographics, payment methods, tenure, contract types, and whether the customer churned or not.

> Key features:
Gender, Partner, Dependents: Customer demographics.
Tenure: Duration of customer association.
Contract: Type of contract (monthly, one-year, two-year).
PaymentMethod: Payment options used by the customer.
MonthlyCharges: Customer's monthly expenditure.
Churn: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

## Project Workflow
> Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical representations (using one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

> Calculate the overall churn rate.
Analyze customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status.
Explore the relationship between tenure and churn.
Examine how churn varies across contract types and payment methods.
Visualize churn rates for different customer segments.

> Customer Segmentation:
Segment customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
Identify high-value customers at risk of churning.

> Churn Prediction:
Select and implement machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
Perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

> Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the best model using the testing dataset.
Interpret feature importance or coefficients to understand key churn factors.
Generate ROC curves and calculate AUC for performance assessment.

> Business Recommendations:
Provide actionable insights based on the analysis and predictive models.
Suggest retention strategies, special offers for high-risk customers, and customer engagement tactics.
