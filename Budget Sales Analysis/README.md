# Budget-Sales-Analytics

## Project Overview
> The Budget Sales Analytics project analyzes the sales and budget data from a retail business to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product performance, and geographic sales distribution. The objective is to compare actual sales against the budget, identify key metrics and relationships, and provide actionable insights through visualizations using Tableau.

## Technologies Used
Python (Data Cleaning and Preparation)
Tableau (Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation)
Microsoft Excel (Data Storage)

## Project Objectives
> Sales vs. Budget Variance: Analyze the difference between actual sales and budgeted sales across time periods, products, and categories.
Customer Segmentation: Explore customer demographics, including income, gender, marital status, and number of children.
> Product Performance: Identify top-performing products and underperforming products based on sales and budget variance.
> Territory Sales: Investigate the geographical sales distribution and performance across various regions.

## Datasets

Calender: Date-related information for mapping sales trends.
Customers: Demographic information about customers (gender, income, children, etc.).
Product: Product catalog with details such as price and cost.
Territory: Geographical sales regions.
Sales: Sales transaction data, including date, territory, and product sold.
> Budget.xlsx:
Contains budgeted sales for various product categories, subcategories, and months.

## Data Cleaning Process
Removed unnecessary and unnamed columns with mostly null values.
Merged sales data with budget data to compute variance between actual sales and budgeted sales.
Standardized date formats for time-series analysis.
Verified customer and product data for consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Segmented customers by income, marital status, gender, and number of children to identify key customer groups.

> Product Performance:
Analyzed top-performing products and underperforming ones to focus marketing efforts on products that need more attention.

> Territory Sales:
Compared sales performance across different geographical territories to highlight regional opportunities and challenges.
